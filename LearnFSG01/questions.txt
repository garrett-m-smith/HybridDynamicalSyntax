Questions for Harry

---Derive the form of the dzvarimat (in field11.m)

---Why does the discrepancy between the separation and the linear estimate of the separation vary with the square of the base?

%% From Learn11

---Is the field function for zz(5) (time) indeed 1?  (proj is mostly NaN if dz5/dt = 0)

---When doing element-by-element testing of Jacobians (e.g., pert = ibit(3, sys.nstatevars), what is being tested?

---Note that when partial derivatives are constantly 0 because a particular variable 
   is fixed at 0 (because of the choice of initial state and the form of the dynamics), then
   the perturbation test can fail to uncover an erroneous derivative form.
